# Realm Provider 

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/decentraland/realm-provider/badge.svg?branch=coverage)](https://coveralls.io/github/decentraland/realm-provider?branch=coverage)

The realm provider service offers a realm description ([ADR-110](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-110)) detailing the services clients need to connect. It can select any Catalyst and Lambdas service from the Catalyst Network and provides access to the default MAIN realm, managed by the [Archipelago workers](https://github.com/decentraland/archipelago-workers), to direct users to a default location. 

## Development 

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn test
yarn start
```
